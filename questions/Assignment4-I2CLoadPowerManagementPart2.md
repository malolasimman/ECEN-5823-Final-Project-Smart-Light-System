*Be sure to take measurements with logging disabled to ensure your logging logic is not impacting current/time measurements.*

*Please include screenshots of the profiler window detailing each current measurement captured.  See the file Instructions to add screenshots in assignment.docx in the ECEN 5823 Student Public Folder.* 


1. What is the average current per period? (Remember, once you have measured your average current, average current is average current over all time. Average current doesnâ€™t carry with it the units of the timespan over which it was measured).
   <br>Answer: 20.20uA (micro amps)

2. What is the ave current from the time we sleep the MCU to EM3 until we power-on the 7021 in response to the LETIMER0 UF IRQ?
   <br>Answer: 2.47uA (micro amps)

3. What is the ave current from the time we power-on the 7021 until we get the COMP1 IRQ indicating that the 7021's maximum time for conversion (measurement) has expired.
   <br>Answer: 529.62uA (micro amps)

4. How long is the Si7021 Powered On for 1 temperature reading?
   <br>Answer: 100.4ms (milli seconds)

5. Given the average current per period from Q1, calculate the operating time of the system for a 1000mAh battery? - ignoring battery manufacturers, efficiencies and battery derating - just a first-order calculation.
   <br>Answer (in hours): average current per period is 20.20uA, which is equivalent to 0.0202mA
                         so for operating time of the system for a 1000mAh battery is 1000/0.0202 = 49504.9504 hours. 
                           therefore operatime of the battery is 49504.9504 hours.


   
6. How has the power consumption performance of your design changed since the previous assignment?
